# Biological_computation_project
Biological Computation final project
By: Ilya Lipovan and Samy Nehmad
## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use Python 3.7 or higher.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the project, set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the script.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elemenopi/Biological_computation_project
cd Biological_computation_project

### 2. Create virtual enviroment
python -m venv venv
### 3. Activate virtual enviroment
windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

linux/mac:
source venv/bin/activate
### 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 5.run

python findMonotonic.py
result is in monotonic_functions_table.png
Project Structure
findMonotonic.py: The main script that generates, filters, and visualizes monotonic functions.
utils.py: A utility module containing helper functions for generating combinations, checking monotonicity, and mapping values to colors.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.

Second part of the project is located in file: biologic_computation_final_2.pdf
